This project allows you to monitor the status of GPIO pins on RaspberryPi-like devices. It consists of a local Rust/Lumen application and a cloud Laravel application.

The frontend language reflects exactly what I was testing this against: A small USB vacuum!

To run this application, you would need to deploy both applications to their respective hardware and edit the .env of each app.
